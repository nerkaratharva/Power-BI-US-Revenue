# Power BI US Revenue Dashboard Documentation
## Overview
Welcome to the documentation for the US Revenue Power BI Dashboard! This document provides a concise overview of the key features and insights offered by the dashboard. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the attached files on my GitHub account. The aim of this project is to exhibit my skills in analyzing and visualizing Sales data with user friendly navigation using Power BI.
## Introduction 
The US Revenue Power BI Dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights into sales trends, ratings, and relationships within a given dataset. It offers a user-friendly interface and employs effective visualization techniques to enhance understanding.
The Report consists of three pages:

1.  **Homepage** 
2.  **Sales**
3.  **Ratings**

## Problem Statement 
Develop a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize US revenue trends and ratings. The dashboard should display yearly sales trends, ratings for top/bottom states and manufacturers, and provide interactive insights into sales by category and country. Create an intuitive user interface with filters and dynamic rankings for manufacturers and products. The goal is to enhance data-driven decision-making and provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance and customer satisfaction.
